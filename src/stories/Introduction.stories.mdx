# Welcome to lunatic-DSFR

Lunatic-DSFR is a library of customised [Lunatic](https://github.com/InseeFr/Lunatic) components built with TypeScript and [React-DSFR](https://react-dsfr.etalab.studio/).

This library is designed to be an opt-in solution to replace the native style of Lunatic with the style of the [French Design system](https://systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/).
